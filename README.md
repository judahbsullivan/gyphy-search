# Gyphy Search

A modern GIF picker application built with Next.js 16 and the GIPHY API.

## Project Assessment

This project demonstrates:
- **Architecture**: Next.js App Router with React Server Components for efficient data fetching.
- **Client Features**: Real-time debounced search, URL state synchronization, and clipboard integration.
- **Performance**: Use of MP4 video previews instead of heavy GIF files for optimized loading.
- **Resilience**: Graceful error handling and localStorage-based fallback for API rate limits.
